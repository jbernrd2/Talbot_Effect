This is a folder containing data for the real and imaginary parts of solutions to the schrodinger equation.
Each file is a comma delimited text file, with three values per row. 
The first value of the row is the real part of the solution
The second value of the row is the imaginary part of the solution
The third value of the row is the x position of the real and imaginary parts

Each file name is named as follows:
    "LinSch_(step function used)_(time at which the data was calculated)
    
    

I hope this helps, if you have any questions ask me whenever: 630-696-6506
